# TODO

- Create a benchmark script that runs various benchmarks with different user totals, edge totals between users etc. Make this run with `npm run benchmark`
- Plot these benchmarks on a graph.
- Create a simulation where each user is a circle, you can click on a user to see all their trusted people surrounding them, and all the people they trust in a second layer etc. With trust on each edge and the trust rating of each user in their circle.
- When a node is clicked it moves to the center and other nodes 1 layer and 2 layers out move around it
- When a node is clicked other nodes are colored red -> green based on trust level
- Color the edges based on the trust rating they give
- Make edges smaller so it's easier to see (and possibly nodes too).
