# TODO

- Create a benchmark script that runs various benchmarks with different user totals, edge totals between users etc.
- Plot these benchmarks on a graph.
- Create a simulation where each user is a circle, you can click on a user to see all their trusted people surrounding them, and all the people they trust in a second layer etc. With trust on each edge and the trust rating of each user in their circle.
