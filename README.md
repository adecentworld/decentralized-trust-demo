# Decentralized Trust Demo

This is a demo of the Decentralized Trust system [as described on A Decentralized World](https://adecentralizedworld.com).

It creates a few hundred to a few thousand random users with a few thousand links between them. Then it allows you to select any user and show that users trust of all others.

It is both a demo of how the trust algorithm works, as well as a benchmark to show how fast it can be to calculate trust ratings client side.

## Usage

`npm start` - Start the trust demo. This will launch it in your browser.
`npm run test` - Run the test suite.
`npm run benchmark` - Run the benchmarking suite.
